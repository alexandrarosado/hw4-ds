            Hi there! Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Alex Rosado, and I am a rising senior at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, studying Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing and a minor in Data Science. While I have grown to love Boston, home will always be New York &lt;3 <br>
            Throughout my time at school, I have aimed to create community wherever I go and give back as much as I can. I've had the opportunity to go on Alternative Spring Breaks to the Dominican Republic and London, and I also co-founded the Northeastern Chapter of the <a href="https://www.alpfa.org/">Association of Latino Professionals for America</a>. <br>
            My service to the greater Boston community was recognized through the <a href="https://latinx.sites.northeastern.edu/lacla/">La Cla scholarship</a>, a full-tuition award granted to only eight students annually to honor their impact. I also completed a co-op at the Boston Consulting Group last fall on their Career and Executive Services team and was offered 
            an extension to my contract throughout the spring. I believe my skills and passions have set me up to contribute to Google's commitment to making a positive impact on the world. <br>

            A fun fact about me is that I am obsessed with capybaras. I aspire to be as nonchalant as they are and will gladly give you a capybara sticker! I also practiced martial arts for 10 years and credit my discipline to my instructor.
